# Edge-Irregular-k-Labeling

### Find out the best data-structure to represent / store the graph in memory.
An adjacency list was chosen as the optimal data structure for representing and storing the graph for both probelm 1 and 2 as solution for probelm 2 applies to problem 1

#### Problem 1: Homogenous amalgamated Star: S_n,3 (Ashna)
This adjacency list is maintained within a Python class named Graph, which also encapsulates additional graph attributes such as n, k, order, vertex_labels, and edge_weights. The adjacency list itself is implemented as a dictionary, where each key corresponds to a vertex and its associated value is a list of the vertex's neighbors. This implementation facilitates efficient access to the neighbors of any given vertex, which is crucial for the performance of the graph labeling algorithm utilized in the project. This approach ensures both the simplicity of access and the efficiency of storage, aligning with the objectives of effective graph manipulation and data handling.

#### Problem 2: Homogenous amalgamated Star: S_n,m (Melisa)
(Also serves as solution to probelm 1) As in Problem 1, an adjacency list within a Graph class is used to store the graph’s structure. This adjacency list is implemented using a dictionary where keys represent vertices, and values are lists of adjacent vertices, facilitating efficient access to neighbors necessary for the graph labeling algorithm. Additionally, Problem 2 introduces an edge set, implemented as a Python set, named edge_weights_set. This set maintains a collection of possible edge weights that are yet to be used. The utilization of a set data structure here is pivotal for ensuring that the assignment of edge weights is unique and efficient, as sets inherently prevent duplicate entries and allow for rapid checks of membership, additions, and deletions. The approach of returning the minimum value in the set provides a O(1) retreival much faster than incrementing a value in searching through an array of edges until the the value is not in the edge_weights array. 


- Adjacency list: It uses an array of linked lists or arrays to represent the graph, where each element represents a vertex and its adjacent vertices. It is efficient for sparse graphs and consumes less memory. It allows efficient traversal of adjacent vertices.

- Edge list: It represents the graph as a list of edges, where each edge contains the source and destination vertices. It is simple and memory-efficient, but it may require additional data structures for efficient traversal and edge lookup.

### What design strategy you will apply, also give justifications that selectedstrategy is most appropriate.

The design strategy used appears to be a systematic approach for assigning labels to vertices of a graph based on certain rules and conditions. It doesn’t neatly fit into a single category of algorithms, but it shares characteristics with constructive algorithms. Constructive algorithms build a solution piece by piece, following a set of rules or conditions. In this case, the algorithm constructs vertex labels for a graph according to a predefined procedure based on the number of vertices and their positions within the graph. It doesn't optimize a specific objective function or make choices based on optimization criteria as seen in many optimization algorithms. 

### How traversing will be applied?

Traversing the graph to label the vertices is using BF or Breadth-First labeling. The internal vertices are labeled first (the ones directly connected to the center of the graph). Then finally the leaf nodes or external vertices are labeled last. 

### Store the labels of vertices and weights of the edges as an outcome.

#### Problem 1:
Edges are stored in the edge_weights data member of the Graph class, which is implemented as a dictionary. Vertex labels are similarly maintained within the vertex_labels data member of the Graph class.

#### Problem 2:
Graph data of labels and edge weights along with estimated time complexity will be stored in an output file named graph_output.txt once a run completes. The file will be overwritten with another run so save files as desired after each run.

   
### Compare your results with mathematical property and tabulate the outcomes for comparison.

**Time Complexity**
   
      a. Vertex Labeling (`vertex_k_labeling` method):
        - Setting the label for the central vertex takes constant time, O(1).
        - Labeling internal vertices involves a loop that iterates from 1 to `n`, performing constant time operations within each iteration. So, it has a time complexity of O(`n`).
        - Labeling external vertices also involves a loop that iterates from 1 to ceil(`n`/4) + 1, performing constant time operations within each iteration. So, it has a time complexity of O(`n`).
        - Overall, the time complexity of vertex labeling is O(`n`).
      
      b. Calculating Edge Weights (`calculate_edge_weights` method):
        - Iterating over the adjacency list takes O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
        - For each vertex and its neighbors, calculating the edge weight involves constant time operations.
        - Therefore, the time complexity of calculating edge weights is O(V + E).
      
      c. Adding Edges to the Graph (`add_edge` method):
        - Adding an edge involves appending vertices to the adjacency list, which is an O(1) time complexity operation.
        - Therefore, the time complexity of adding edges depends on the number of edges added, but in this case, it's O(E).
      
      d. Combining These Operations:
        - Vertex Labeling: O(`n`)
        - Calculating Edge Weights: O(V + E)
        - Adding Edges: O(E)
        - Since the dominant operations are vertex labeling and calculating edge weights, the overall time complexity of the algorithm would be O(`n` + V + E), which simplifies to O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

**Overall Time Complexity Calculation Example:**
Time Complexity = O(25 + 24) = O(49)
